# Jack Ma's New Hobby

## Problem Statement: <br>
Sitting in a Chinese prison for a misunderstanding, Jack Ma developed a hobby of dominoes art. While putting together, arguably the best domino art the prison had seen, he began to wonder…
What if I had an infinite supply of _1 × 2_ and _2 × 1_ dominoes and had to fill an _N × 2_ grid?
For example, Jack can fill a _2 × 2_ grid using 2 _1 × 2_ dominoes or 2 _2 × 1_ dominoes. Find the total number of ways Jack can fill an _N × 2_ grid using only _1 × 2_ and _2 × 1_ dominoes.
