# Alien Test

**Problem Statement:** <br>
The government was sure that Mark Zuckerberg was a lizard alien, but they didn’t have any proof. They devised a test to confirm their suspicions. If Mark couldn’t solve a math question, they could be sure that he really isn’t a human. 

Mark has to find an array _C_ of length such that each element is the product of the corresponding elements in _A_ and _B_. Formally, _C<sub>i</sub>_ = _A<sub>i</sub>_ * _B<sub>i</sub>_ (1 &le; _i_ &le; _N_).

Help Mark prove to the government that he actually is a human. 

**Constraints:** <br>
 - 1 &le; _N_ &le; 10<sup>5</sup>
 - 1 &le; _A<sub>i</sub>_, _B<sub>i</sub>_ &le; 10<sup>9</sup>

**Input Format:** <br>
 - The first line contains a single integer _N_
 - The second line contains _N_ space separated integers denoting the elements of array _A_
 - The third line contains _N_ space separated integers denoting the elements of array _B_

**Output Format:** <br>
 - Print _N_ space separated integers denoting the elements of array _C_ in a single line

**Sample input:** <br>
```

1 5 2 4 6
1 8 9 5 6
```

**Sample output:** <br>
```
1 40 18 20 36
