# NPS-INR-Cyber-Programming-2021
The 2021 edition of the NPS Indiranagar interhouse Cyber Programming contest.

The preliminary round was held on 6th August 2021. 21 students partecipated in the contest and attempted to solve 8 problems in 1 hour. The top 4 students from each house were selected for the final round.

Under the Prelims folder you can find 8 folders containing the details of each problem. Each folder consists of:
 - Problem Statement: ```Question.md```
 - Solutions: ```Solution.py```, ```Solution.cpp```
 - Test inputs: ```input/inputxx.txt```
 - Test outputs: ```output/outputxx.txt```
 - Subtask distribution: ```Subtasks.txt```
 - Test data generator: ```Generator.py```

To generate more test data, run the ```Test Data Generator.py``` script and input the relative problem folder path (e.g. ```Prelims/Problem 1```). Edit the ```Subtasks.txt``` file to generate more data of different subtasks.
